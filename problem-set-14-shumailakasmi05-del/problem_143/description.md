## Problem: Sort by Parity Then Value

### Description
Write a program that reads a list of space-separated integers and prints them sorted by parity, then by value. All even numbers should appear first in ascending order, followed by all odd numbers in ascending order.

### Input Format
Single line containing space-separated integers

### Output Format
Print the integers sorted by parity (evens first, then odds), with each group in ascending order, separated by spaces
